# Developer_test
### Please create Flutter app (Android platform) according to a Figma design 
#### [Design UPDATED](https://www.figma.com/file/2bVcKXtciQcxeQvKuVeXLQ/Developer-Test?node-id=0%3A1)
#### [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/2bVcKXtciQcxeQvKuVeXLQ/Developer-Test?node-id=5%3A165&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=4%3A4)
### Use following API for application data [JSONplaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
#### [Users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
#### [Albums](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums)
#### [Photos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos)

#### Description
The Albums page should display only albums related to selected user. On the Photos page displays only first 20 photos of the selected album. The number of total photos should reflect total album's photos count.
#### Bonus
It would be a plus if [Expansion Panel Widget ](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ExpansionPanel-class.html) is used for the list of albums.
